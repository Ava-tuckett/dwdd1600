       <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
       <h2>What it Says</h2>
       <p>The Declaration of Independence announces the American colonies' separation from Britain, <em>asserting fundamental rights to "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,"</em> stating governments derive power from consent, and listing grievances against King George III to justify revolution, concluding the colonies are now Free & Independent States with full sovereign powers. It proclaims that all men are created equal and have the right to alter or abolish oppressive governments.</p> 
       <p>formally announced that the 13 American colonies were severing their political ties with Great Britain to become free and independent states. It begins with a <strong>preamble</strong> that establishes the philosophical foundation for government, famously asserting that "all men are created equal" and possess unalienable rights to <strong>life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness</strong>. The document argues that governments exist only to protect these rights and derive their just power from the "consent of the governed"; if a government fails this duty, the people have a right and a duty to "alter or to abolish it". To justify this drastic break, it provides a extensive list of <strong>27 specific grievances</strong> against King George III, accusing him of establishing a tyranny through unfair taxes, denying trial by jury, and maintaining standing armies without consent. Finally, the text concludes by declaring the colonies' new status as sovereign nations with the full power to wage war, conclude peace, and form alliances, ending with a mutual pledge</p>

       <h2>Why we are upset</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>The colonists were primarily upset about a perceived <strong>betrayal of their rights as British citizens.</strong> After decades of "salutary neglect" where the colonies mostly governed themselves, Britain began exerting strict control and imposing heavy taxes to pay off debts from the French and Indian War</li>
        <li>Essentially, the colonists felt that instead of acting like a protective father, the King had become a tyrant whose actions proved he was "unfit to be the ruler of a free people".</li>
