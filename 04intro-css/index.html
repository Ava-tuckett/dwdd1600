       <h1>What you need to know about Ferrets</h1>
       <h2>how to take care of them</h2>
       <p>Ferrets are playful, intelligent members of the Mustelidae family, related to weasels, otters, and badgers. Often described as "kittens that never grow up," they are crepuscular animals that are most active during dawn and dusk.</p>
       <p>hese crepuscular animals are famous for the "weasel war dance"—a joyful display of hopping and "dooking"—and their mischievous habit of stealing small household objects, a trait reflected in their name, which comes from the Latin for "little thief." While they make affectionate pets that can be litter box trained, they require significant commitment, including strict ferret-proofing of the home and specialized care from an exotic animal veterinarian to manage common health issues like adrenal disease. Though they sleep up to 20 hours a day, their high energy during waking hours and social nature make them best suited for owners who can provide plenty of interaction, though potential owners should check local laws as they remain illegal in places like California and Hawaii.</p>
