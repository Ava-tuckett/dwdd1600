       <h1>What supplies you need</h1>
       <h2>Veterinary care</h2>
       <p>To keep a ferret healthy, provide a high-protein, meat-based diet and access to fresh water at all times to satisfy their fast metabolism. They require at least two to four hours of daily supervised exercise in a ferret-proofed environment to stimulate their high intelligence and social needs. Finally, ensure they receive annual checkups from an exotic animal veterinarian for essential vaccinations and screenings for common conditions like adrenal disease.</p>
       <dl>
            <dt>Dietary Requirements</dt>
            <dd>As obligate carnivores, ferrets require a diet high in animal protein and fat, but very low in fiber and carbohydrates. They lack a cecum to digest plant matter, so they must be fed high-quality ferret kibble or raw meat diets specifically formulated for their needs.</dd>

            <dt>Housing and Environment</dt>
            <dd>Ferrets need a large, multi-level wire cage with solid flooring (to protect their feet) and plenty of soft bedding like blankets or hammocks. While they spend much of their time in the cage, they require several hours of daily supervised out-of-cage time in a "ferret-proofed" area.</dd>

            <dt>Social Interaction</dt>
            <dd>Ferrets are highly social creatures that thrive on companionship. They should ideally be kept in pairs or groups ("a business") and require significant daily interaction and play with their human owners to prevent boredom and depression.</dd>

            <dt>Hygiene and Grooming</dt>
            <dd>Care includes regular nail trimming, ear cleaning, and teeth brushing. While they have a natural musky scent, they should not be bathed frequently (no more than once a month), as over-bathing strips their skin of oils and actually increases the odor. Cleaning their bedding weekly is the best way to manage smell.</dd>

            <dt>Veterinary Care</dt>
            <dd>Ferrets require annual checkups with an exotic animal veterinarian. They need vaccinations for rabies and canine distemper, as well as regular screening for common ferret ailments such as adrenal disease, insulinoma, and heartworm.</dd>

            <dt>Ferret-Proofing</dt>
            <dd>Because of their flexible spines and curious nature, owners must secure the home by blocking small gaps under appliances, removing toxic plants, and ensuring they cannot swallow foam, rubber, or plastic items which can cause fatal intestinal blockages.</dd>

       <h2>Care</h2>
       <h3>Pros</h3>
       <ul>
        <li> <strong><em>Endless Entertainment:</em></strong>Their playful "weasel war dance" and curious antics make them some of the funniest pets you can own</li>
        <li> <strong><em>Quiet & Compact:</em></strong> They are perfect for apartments because they rarely make noise and sleep for up to 20 hours a day. </li>
        <li> <strong><em>Highly Social:</em></strong> Ferrets form deep bonds with their owners and often act like affectionate, lifelong kittens.</li>    
        <li> <strong><em>Smart & Trainable:</em></strong>You can litter box train them and even teach them to walk on a leash for outdoor adventures.</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Cons</h3>
       <ul>
        <li> <strong><em>The "Ferret Smell":</em></strong>Even with cleaning, they have a natural musky odor that can be off-putting to some.</li>
        <li> <strong><em>High Maintenance:</em></strong>They require strict ferret-proofing because they can get stuck in walls, appliances, or swallow dangerous items.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Expensive Healthcare:</em></strong>They are prone to serious health issues like adrenal disease, requiring specialized (and often pricey) exotic vet care.</li>
        <li> <strong><em>Legal Restrictions:</em></strong>They are illegal to own in some areas, including California and Hawaii, so you must check local laws before adopting.</li>
       </ul>
